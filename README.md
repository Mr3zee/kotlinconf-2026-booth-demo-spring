# Spring + Kotlin Demo (KotlinConf '26)

A demo project showcasing **Spring + Kotlin** scenarios — how to take an existing Spring Boot application and evolve it to use Kotlin in different ways.

The codebase is a stripped-down Spring Petclinic used purely as a realistic carrier for the demo.
The interesting part is *not* the app itself but the **build/setup and code migrations** demonstrated on different branches,
driven by the prompts in [`prompts/`](prompts/).

## Demo scenarios (prompts)

Each prompt drives the demo from the `main` branch state to a target setup. See [`prompts/README.md`](prompts/README.md) for the full list and the branch each one produces.

## Running the app

You are on the `kotlin-maven` branch — the build is Maven + Kotlin (no Gradle):

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Then open http://localhost:8080/.
